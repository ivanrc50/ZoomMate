# ZoomMate

A lightweight AutoIt (AU3) script that automates common Zoom tasks for meetings of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses. Designed to let AV operators focus less on Zoom controls, this script handles routine actions like opening meetings, managing host tools, and streamlining the virtual meeting experience.

## How To Use

1. **Configure your meeting settings:**
   - Run the script or compiled app to use launch the configuration GUI.
   - Set your Meeting ID, meeting times, and language.

2. **Run the script:**
   - Double-click `ZoomMate.au3` if you have AutoIt installed.
   - Or compile it to an executable as described below.

3. **Compile to EXE (optional):**
   - Use the AutoIt compiler `Aut2exe.exe` to create a standalone executable.
   - Example command line:

    ```powershell
     Aut2exe.exe /in "ZoomMate.au3" /out "ZoomMate.exe" /icon "zoommate.ico"
     ```

   - This will generate `ZoomMate.exe` with your custom icon.

4. **Start ZoomMate:**
   - Run the compiled EXE or the AU3 script.
   - The tray icon will appear; click it to access configuration.

5. **Automation:**
   - ZoomMate will automatically launch Zoom and manage meeting controls based on your schedule.
